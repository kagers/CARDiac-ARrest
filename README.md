# CARDiac-ARrest
<h3> An augmented reality implementation of the card game, "War." </h3>
Developed in Processing by Daisy Barbanel, Sandy Fang, Mariya Gedrich, and Katherine Gershfeld. Created over the course of one month at CSTUY SHIP 2015. 

<h3>Installation</h3>
To run, git clone and run cardashians.pde from the "cardashians" directory. Requires a webcam (preferably detachable) installation of Processing and the <a href=https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing>OpenCV for Processing</a> library.
<br>
<h3>Rules and Gameplay</h3>
The program recognizes the cards that players put down and overlays an animation that simulates gameplay. To play, two users must place down two cards at a time in front of the camera. The player with the higher card wins the hand and takes all of the played cards. In the case of war (when the cards are of equal value), players must remove their original cards from the camera's field of vision, place two facedown cards offscreen, and play the final card face-up in front of the camera. The game keeps track of each player's score.
